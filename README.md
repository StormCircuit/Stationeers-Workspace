Storm's Stationeers Scripts (SSS) Repo

Backups of all my MIPS scripts. Use them at your own caution.

automation folder contains minifier.js which can take an input ic10 file and reduce the line numbers by stripping out human readable portions of the code like labels and constants. Credit for the script goes to dev_doggo on the Stationeers Discord.
